position you would like to play in a config header after preferance (def > atk > mid for example)

queue up, vote for a map
the longer you wait, the greater skill difference will be (elo +- bounce increases)
if players found, match their votes, set up the server, auto-connect to the server

on server: have a cvar which disables certain features:
- each player has to ready up before it starts (autotimer?)
- votes are disabled
- team menus to join are disabled / autoforce players to their team
- disable subs
- gets a match id to identify the match

callback server -> master
- when half ended
- when player left

how to handle certain situations:
- a player leaves before the match ends
- a player doesnt show up
