position you would like to play in a config header after preferance (def > atk > mid for example)

queue up, vote for a map
the longer you wait, the greater skill difference will be (elo +- bounce increases)
if players found, match their votes, set up the server, auto-connect to the server

on server: have a cvar which disables certain features:
- each player has to ready up before it starts (autotimer?)
- votes are disabled
- team menus to join are disabled / autoforce players to their team
- disable subs
- gets a match id to identify the match

callback server -> master
- when half ended
- when player left

how to handle certain situations:
- a player leaves before the match ends
- a player doesnt show up




todo:
[x] sort queueplayers by queuetime (so the longest players are checked first)
[x] pause queue time when joining a match (aka dont continue counting if hes waiting to accept and the match fails to happen)
[ ] notify players of changes
[x] handle timeouts of players ("player quits via alt-f4") [if reconnects (a new HELLO message), take out of queue]
[ ] clean playerlist from time to time
[ ] handle results from matches
[ ] expand gamemode to own class with attributes (such as 2x10 instead of 1x20)
[x] mmserver handles all gametypes on the same port
[x] gameserver needs to send a HELLO message when enabled [rcon send from mmserver to request its hello-status] (to have a qport queue)
[x] mmserver has to check gameserver frequently if its still available (in case the server network timed out)
[ ] gameserver has to send a bye message when disabled (or shut down)
[x] gameserver has to have an rcon password set
[ ] load player elo
[O] FOR THE FUTURE: handle prefered position
[O] FOR THE FUTURE: ringer option? reconnect option?
