**UrTMatchMaking Server**

This project was an attempt to create a matchmaking server for Urban Terror 4.x.
Beware that this is all experimental and poorly-written code that I wrote several years ago.
This was even written before I joined FrozenSand and is therefore purely independent of my work for FrozenSand.

To further clarify: this is simply a matchmaking *server* and lacks the necessary client/game code changes of UrbanTerror.

However, this still might serve as a proof of concept and as a source of inspiration to some.
